🗺️ Hashtag#30DayMapChallenge – 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭𝟮: 𝗠𝗮𝗽 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝟮𝟭𝟮𝟱

𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐞 𝟐𝟏𝟐𝟓 – 𝐀 𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐆𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐬𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐔𝐫𝐛𝐚𝐧 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞

I wasn’t sure what a map from the year 2125 should look like, so today I took it a bit easier. Instead of building a traditional map, I experimented with AI and ended up creating a small futuristic urban-planning simulation for 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟭𝟮𝟱.

𝙇𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙩𝙚𝙭𝙩, 𝙢𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙞𝙩𝙮. The result? A mix of surprising visuals, slightly chaotic future vibes, and a few moments where even I thought: “𝙊𝙠𝙖𝙮 𝘼𝙄, 𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙭… 𝙞𝙩’𝙨 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝘽𝙡𝙖𝙙𝙚 𝙍𝙪𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙧.” 🚀🌆

Here is my 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗻𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗮 𝟮𝟭𝟮𝟱  video in German (English version in the comments). The German version turned out a bit more serious… maybe the LLM took my German prompts too literally (Hastag Hashtag#BIAS) 😊 

Have a look and let me know how you imagine Cologne in the future.
